# Utility ShellS cripts
A collection of shell scripts (for Linux) I have made / continue to create to automate several tasks I have done / do for video, audio, graphics, and office tasks.  These are predominantely bash scripts.

## GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
(As of 12/21/2021) In any release currently maintained with security updates for Debian, Ubuntu and any of their derivatives:
```
sudo apt install imagemagick ffmpeg
```
- FFMPEG (for all video utility scripts)
- ImageMagick (for all image utility scripts)

## INSTALLATION
I plan on creating an install, an update, and a utility to check for updates as well.

For now:
- Create ~/.local/bin (if it does not exist)
- Move all .sh files into that newly created folder
- Restart your computer (if you had to create the ~/.local/bin folder)
